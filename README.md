### üåü Introduction

This project is a faithful recreation of the iconic Pacman arcade game, implemented in MASM x86 Assembly language. The game runs in a terminal/console window, using ASCII art for visual design, and provides an engaging retro experience. Players navigate through mazes, eat food pellets, avoid ghosts, and collect bonuses, with sound effects for added immersion.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Language:** MASM x86 Assembly
- **Includes:** Uses `irvine32.inc` for basic I/O and console functions.
- **Sound:** Utilizes WAV files for classic Pacman sounds (beginning, chomp, death, fruit, eat ghost).
- **Graphics:** ASCII art for menus, instructions, levels, and in-game screens.
- **Variables:** Tracks player name, score, lives, level, ghost positions, and food count.
- **Structure:** Organized into data section (constants, variables, ASCII screens) and code section (drawing, input, game logic).
- **Custom Procedures:** For coloring, printing screens, moving Pacman, displaying ghosts, and handling input.

#### Sample Level Layout (ASCII Art)

The game features large, detailed ASCII screens for menus and levels, ensuring a visually engaging terminal experience.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Game

1. **Requirements:**  
   - 68k Assembly environment (such as an emulator or assembler that supports `irvine32.inc` and Windows console).
   - Sound files: Ensure the required WAV files are present.
2. **Build & Run:**  
   - Assemble `Main.asm` using your assembler (e.g., MASM for x86).
   - Run the resulting executable in a compatible terminal.
